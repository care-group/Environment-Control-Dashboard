# Prototype for a Preference-based Smart Home Environmenmt Control Dashboard

Utilising a NETATMO indoor air quality monitor (humidity, noise, CO2, and pollution) and live pollen data, this app demonstrates automatic control of windows and air conditioning units in an OpenHAB smart home environment.

This app was developed as part of the SICSA Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Summer School and is a proof of concept only. It is not a complete implementation of the system.
